## Complex Scenario Simulation: Factory Assembly Line

This repository showcases the development of a complex simulation model, specifically tailored to replicate the operations of a factory assembly line, as demonstrated in `FinalStimulation.cpp`. 

The purpose of this simulation was to identify any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the existing workflow. Following the insights gathered from the simulation, I proposed and implemented strategic enhancements to optimize the assembly line process significantly. 

For the final, optimized version of the code, please refer to the `FinalSimulation.cpp` file. For a more detailed understanding of the project, findings, and the strategic improvements implemented, you can read the comprehensive report provided in `MyFactory_Report`.

## Multi-threading in Bitonic Sort and FFT Algorithms

This repository involves the application of multi-threading in the context of Bitonic Sort and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms. The primary focus is to identify strategic points for the integration of multi-threading, with the objective of enhancing computational speed without compromising on the correctness of the algorithms. Under the constraints of utilizing two cores and up to four threads, both algorithms have demonstrated substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving at least a three-fold speed increase.
