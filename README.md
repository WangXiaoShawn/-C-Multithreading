## Multi-threading in Bitonic Sort and FFT Algorithms

This project involves the application of multi-threading in the context of Bitonic Sort and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms. The primary focus is to identify strategic points for the integration of multi-threading, with the objective of enhancing computational speed without compromising on the correctness of the algorithms. Under the constraints of utilizing two cores and up to four threads, both algorithms have demonstrated substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving at least a three-fold speed increase.

## Complex Scenario Simulation: Factory Assembly Line

The project also includes the simulation of complex scenarios, specifically within the context of a factory assembly line. By creating a dynamic simulation of the assembly line, strategic deficiencies were identified within the existing operations. Leveraging these insights, strategic improvements were proposed and implemented, leading to effective optimization of the overall assembly line process.
